### 12. Ideal Weight (General Formula)  
Using height as input data, build an algorithm that calculates ideal weight using the following formula:  
Ideal Weight = (72.7 * height) - 58

### 13. Ideal Weight (Men and Women)

### 14. Fish Weight Excess  
John Fish-Talker bought a microcomputer to control his daily work income. Every time he brings a fish weight greater than established by SÃ£o Paulo state fishing regulations (50 kilos), he must pay a fine of R$ 4.00 per excess kilo. John needs you to make a program that reads the weight variable (fish weight) and calculates the excess.

### 16. Paint Store (Paint Can Calculation)  
Make a program for a paint store. The program should ask for the size in square meters of the area to be painted. Consider that the paint coverage is 1 liter for every 3 square meters and that the paint is sold in 18-liter cans that cost R$ 80.00. Inform the user of the number of paint cans to be purchased and the total price.

### 17. Paint Store (Cans and Gallons)  
Make a program for a paint store. The program should ask for the size in square meters of the area to be painted. Consider that the paint coverage is 1 liter for every 6 square meters and that the paint is sold in 18-liter cans that cost R$ 80.00, or in 3.6-liter gallons that cost R$ 25.00.

The program should inform the user of the quantities of paint to be purchased and their respective prices in the following situations:
- Buy only 18-liter cans.
- Buy only 3.6-liter gallons.
- Mix cans and gallons so that paint waste is minimized. Add 10% margin and always round values up.
